# Project Structure

This project is organized as a monorepo containing multiple independent applications and a shared utility package.

## Root Directory

- **`package.json`**: The root configuration file. It contains scripts to manage the entire monorepo (install dependencies, run all apps, build all, etc.).
- **`.gitignore`**: Specifies files and directories to be ignored by Git.

## Applications

### 1. Host Application (`host-app`)

The main container application that loads and orchestrates the remote applications.

- **Location**: `/host-app`
- **Port**: 5000
- **Key Files**:
  - `vite.config.ts`: Configuration for Vite and Module Federation (Host setup).
  - `src/App.tsx`: The main entry point where remotes are typically composed.

### 2. Remote Application 1 (`remote-app-1`)

A micro-frontend application exposing modules for the Host to consume.

- **Location**: `/remote-app-1`
- **Port**: 5001
- **Key Files**:
  - `vite.config.ts`: Module Federation configuration (exposing modules).

### 3. Remote Application 2 (`remote-app-2`)

Another micro-frontend application.

- **Location**: `/remote-app-2`
- **Port**: 5002

## Shared Libraries

### Shared Utilities (`shared-utils`)

A package containing common code used across all applications, such as types, constants, helper functions, and the event bus.

- **Location**: `/shared-utils`
- **Port**: 5003 (runs independently for development/testing if needed)
- **Usage**: Added as a dependency in the `package.json` of Host and Remotes.

## Key Directories (Common in Apps)

- **`src/`**: Source code (components, logic, styles).
- **`public/`**: Static assets.
- **`dist/`**: Production build output.
- **`.__mf__temp/`**: Temporary directory generated by Module Federation (should be ignored).
